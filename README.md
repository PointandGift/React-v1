## About This Project
Point and Gift is an application that uses the camera scanning feature that allows users to scan their gift cards to check their total balance, their rewards, and collect coupons and deals from their favourite vendors. It also helps you store all of your gift cards virtually so you can remove the hastle of taking out your wallet every single time just to find out that you lost your gift card.

## Development Approach
As of then, nobody on the team really understood Object Oriented Programming. So we skipped that approach completely and went for the approach we were most familiar with, Procedural Programming. It took our design team nearly half a month to come up with a solid user friendly idea before the concept was handed to the development team to begin the initial paper prototying stage.
